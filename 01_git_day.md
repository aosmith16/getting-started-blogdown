Session 1 - Git Day
================
May 7, 2018

During the first blogdown work session we didn‚Äôt do anything with
blogdown and instead spent time getting Git and GitHub up and running.
Everything here is covered in more detail in [Happy Git and GitHub for
the userR](http://happygitwithr.com/), I simply picked out the main bits
so we could run through things together.

I spent time on Git because I think it‚Äôs easiest to maintain your
website materials on GitHub for continuous deployment. I did not spend
any time talking about Git and version control and why these are
important but it‚Äôs definitely worth [reading through that section of
Happy Git](http://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html).

This document looks fairly long, but we miraculously didn‚Äôt run into any
snags and the group was able to do all of this in less than an hour.

# Register GitHub account

Go to <https://github.com/> and sign up. You‚Äôll need to pick a user name
that you will want to use in the long term and that you‚Äôre happy to
share with people.

You will need to associate your account with an email address. I
recommend picking an email address you will have for the long-term, so
consider using a personal email instead of your temporary school email.
You can change this later if needed (I did), but it is simplest to pick
a long-term email from the start.

# Update R and RStudio to current versions

Make sure you have current versions of R and RStudio. In spring 2018 R
3.5.0 had recently come out and had some major changes so using a
slightly older version of R in the short-term was an OK approach (3.4.4
was the last version before 3.5.0).

# Install Git

## Windows

Install Git for Windows from <https://gitforwindows.org/>.

During installation you can use the defaults for most options. Make sure
the ‚ÄúUse Git from the Windows Command Prompt‚Äù is chosen when ‚ÄúAdjusting
the PATH environment‚Äù. This was the default when I installed things, but
watch for this and make sure.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/git_command_prompt.png)<!-- -->

You should be able to find the executable in `C:/Program
Files/Git/bin/git.exe`.

At the end of installation, launch Git Bash. You don‚Äôt need to review
the release notes.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/git_openbash.png)<!-- -->

## Mac OS

I‚Äôm putting two options here (I don‚Äôt have a Mac so have never tried
either üòú but these are the top two recommendations in Happy Git).

1.  Install Xcode. This can be done using command line tools in the
    shell using `xcode-select --install`.

2.  Install from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.

# Download a Git client (optional)

You‚Äôll see that RStudio now has a basic Git client, which works well
most of the time for maintaining a website made via **blogdown**. You
can also always use the shell.

However, it‚Äôs nice to have an alternative. I use
[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), and have been happy to have it
when I needed it. There are plenty of [other
options](http://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html#recommended-git-clients).

# Introduce yourself to Git in the shell

Open up a shell terminal. In Windows the easiest thing to do is to use
Git Bash.

If you want more background on the shell, see [Appendix
A](http://happygitwithr.com/shell.html) in Happy Git.

You will put in a user name and an email address to be associated with
Git.

The user name can be anything you want.

The command in the shell is:

`git config --global user.name "User Name"` Put your name in place of
`"User Name"`.

The user email should be the email you are using for your GitHub
account.

`git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"`

Check that these changes took.

`git config --global --list`

# Connect to GitHub via the shell

Now we need to make sure Git and GitHub can talk to each other and that
we can make local changes and *push* them on to GitHub.

## Make a new repository on GitHub

Go to your GitHub account. Go to the `+` drop down menu in the upper
righthand corner and choose `New Repository`.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/github_newrepo.png)<!-- -->

1.  Make a repository name. Keep it simple. You cannot have spaces in
    names but can include dashes (hyphens). I used `test` for my first
    test repo, which I will delete at the end of this practice.

2.  Put in a basic description (optional).

3.  Choose `Public`. (This is the default.). All the material in the
    repository will be in the public domain.

4.  Select `Initialize this repository with a README`.

5.  Click the `Create Repository` button.

6.  Once the repository is created, click the `Clone or download` button
    and copy the URL to the clipboard with the clipboard button.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/github_clone.png)<!-- -->

## Clone repository from GitHub onto local computer

For the first test repository, it can be simplest to put the local
directory in your default directory (since we will delete it at the end
of this process).

Paste the URL you copied to the clipboard. I have to right click to
‚ÄúPaste‚Äù in to Git Bash on Windows 7. Not all shells are clipboard
aware, so worst-case scenario you‚Äôll need to type out the URL.

`git clone https://github.com/usernames/reponame.git`

If you want to put the repository in a specific directory, change the
directory away from the default in the shell using `cd`.

You can write out the whole (absolute) file path.  
\- On Windows use forward slashes.  
`cd c:/Users/Owner/Documents`

  - On Mac OS use backslashes. `cd /home/my_username/Desktop`

If you have any spaces in the directory path you‚Äôll need to wrap the
file path in quotes.

## Work in the local repository

The first thing to do is to change the directory to the new folder for
the local repository. The local repository will have the same name as
the GitHub repository. I‚Äôm using the place holder `reponame`.

`cd reponame`

Now interact with the repository in the shell.

  - `ls` To list all the files  
  - `head README.md` To see the top lines of the README file  
  - `git remote show origin` To, e.g., see the URL of the associated
    GitHub repository

## Make a change to a local file

We‚Äôll make a local change that needs to then be pushed on to GitHub.

We can add a line of text to the README in the shell.

`echo "I'm adding a line to README" >> README.md`

Then we can check the status to see that we‚Äôve edited a file locally.

`git status`

## Update GitHub with the local changes

The process for updating the remote repository in Github involves
*staging*, *committing*, and *pushing*.

First, stage any changes. Use `-A` to stage all files that have been
edited.

`git add -A`

Next, commit the changes. You need to add a commit message to say what
change you‚Äôve made.

`git commit -m "Local edit to README"`

Finally, push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub. If you are
new to GitHub you will be asked to enter your GitHub username and
password.

`git push`

Go back to your GitHub repository and see the changes in the README\!

# Connect to GitHub via RStudio

Once you know Git and GitHub are communicating, it‚Äôs time to make sure
we can use RStudio instead of the shell. (You can always use the shell
if that‚Äôs what you are comfortable with.)

Delete the local version of the repository. We‚Äôll make it again via
RStudio.

## Start new Project

In RStudio, go to `File > New Project...`

Select `Version Control`

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/rstudio_vcontrol.png)<!-- -->

And then `Git`

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/rstudio_git.png)<!-- -->

Paste the cloned URL from the remote repository. You can browse to
choose a directory for the local repository if you want to save it
somewhere specific.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/rstudio_clone.png)<!-- -->

The remote files will be downloaded into the new folder and the new
Project will open. You will have a `Git` tab in your ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù Pane
in RStudio.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/rstudio_gittab.png)<!-- -->

**If you cannot make a version control project**

If your RStudio version is up-to-date but you don‚Äôt have the option to
make a ‚Äúversion control‚Äù Project then you have some sort of problem with
Git and RStudio. This is (apparently) more likely to happen on Windows.

The best-case scenario is that you need to tell RStudio where to find
Git.

Go to `Tools > Global Options...` and then choose `Git/SVN`.

Make sure the path to the Git Executable is `C:/Program
Files/Git/bin/git.exe`. Notice it must be in `bin` and not `cmd`. If
not, change the path to the correct one, push `OK`, restart RStudio, and
try the version control Project again.

See [Chapter 14](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) of Happy
Git for more detailed information.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/rstudio_findgit.png)<!-- -->

## Edit local version of README

Once the project opens, open `README.md` and add some text.

## Update GitHub with the local changes

In the `Git` tab in RStudio, stage the README file by clicking on the
box next to it.

Select `Commit` in the `Git` tab, write a message in the ‚ÄúCommit
message‚Äù box in the pop-up window that opens, and then hit the
`Commit` button.

Finally, `Push` to the remote repository. You will be asked for your
username and password.

![](./01_git_day_files/pics/rstudio_push.png)<!-- -->

Go back to your GitHub repository to see the changes.

## Troubleshooting

Did it work? Yay\!

Did something fail? Bummer. Something is wrong. Go to Chapter 15 of
Happy Git, [RStudio, Git, and GitHub
hell](http://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) to try to solve the
problem.
