# Getting started using blogdown

In spring 2018 I offered to do some work sessions on blogdown with a group of graduate students who were interested in making a personal website.  We met a total of four times, and I'm putting my notes for each session here.

Note that all the info here has been gleaned from other available resources.  I simply collated things together to help students streamline the process.

The first session was on getting Git and GitHub going and making sure R and Git could communicate.  Most of the info comes directly from [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/).  This went more smoothly than I had hoped, and we had time to set up keys for SSH so folks don't have to sign in for every push.

The next sessions were info taken directly from the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Alison Hill's blogdown post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/).  

The second session involved installing Hugo, blogdown, and downloading the desired website theme (we all ended up using the [Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic), which is how I ended up with a second website :laughing:).  Once the theme was downloaded we could start changing details from the template to our own details.  The Academic theme is "fancy" compared to a lot of other themes, and so there are good resources for [getting started](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/).

The third session was about deploying the website via Netlify, and was supposed to be the last session.  We ran into some good problems with deployment, though, that I hadn't experienced before and we learned how to read the deployment log to understand which files were causing the trouble.

The fourth session was to finish up deployment and then talk about the website name, either in Netlify or with a custom domain such as one from [rbind.io](https://support.rbind.io/about/).
